# Python Application to view the weather Forecast for the next 5 days. 
- You can search weather forecast for 5 days with data every 3 hours by city name.
- I have used an open source python library called "Streamlit" to build the user interface.
- I have taken the API which provides the weather data from https://openweathermap.org/
- In the app I have added a slider that allows user to choose the number of days for which they want to view the weather forecast.
- User can also choose between viewing the sky conditions or a graph of temperature readings in celcius versus the date.
